Writing Your Own Lint Rules
===========================

Squabble supports loading rule definitions from arbitrary plugin
directories. Every Python file from directories in the configuration's
``"plugin"`` section will be loaded and any classes that inherit from
:func:`squabble.rules.BaseRule` will be registered and available for use.

Concepts
--------

Rules
~~~~~

Rules are classes which inherit from :func:`squabble.rules.BaseRule` and
are responsible for checking the abstract syntax tree of a SQL file.

At a minimum, each rule will define ``def enable(self, root_context, config)``,
which is responsible for doing any initialization when the rule is enabled.

For example ::

  class MyRule(squabble.rules.BaseRule):
      def enable(self, context, config):
          ...

Could be configured with this ``.squabblerc`` ::

  {"rules": {"MyRule": {"foo": "bar"}}}

``enable()`` would be passed ``config={"foo": "bar"}``.

Details
-------

-  Parsing is done using
   `libpg_query <https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query>`__, a Postgres
   query parser.

   -  *theoretically* it will work with other SQL dialects

-  Rules are implemented by registering callbacks while traversing the
   Abstract Syntax Tree of the query.

   -  e.g.Â entering a ``CREATE TABLE`` node registers a callback for a
      column definition node, which checks that the column type is
      correct.

As a somewhat unfortunate consequence of our reliance on libpg_query,
the abstract syntax tree is very, very specific to Postgres. While
developing new rules, it will be necessary to reference the `Postgres
AST
Node <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/include/nodes/parsenodes.h;hb=HEAD>`__
source listing, or, more readably, the `Python
bindings <https://github.com/lelit/pglast/tree/master/pglast/enums>`__.

Example Rule

       in CAPSLOCK NOTATION.
